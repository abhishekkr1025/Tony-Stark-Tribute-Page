                Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was
                co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists
                Don Heck and Jack Kirby. The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated
                March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968). Also in 1963, the character founded
                the Avengers alongside Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk.

                A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and ingenious scientist, Anthony
                Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force
                him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his
                life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological
                devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to
                protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually publicly
                reveals himself to be Iron Man.
                Initially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War themes, particularly the role of
                American technology and industry in the fight against communism. Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man
                have transitioned from Cold War motifs to contemporary matters of the time.[1]

                Throughout most of the character's publication history, Iron Man has been a founding member of the
                superhero team the Avengers and has been featured in several incarnations of his own various comic book
                series. Iron Man has been adapted for several animated TV shows and films. In the Marvel Cinematic
                Universe, the character was portrayed by Robert Downey Jr., appearing in the films Iron Man (2008), The
                Incredible Hulk (2008) in a cameo, Iron Man 2 (2010), The Avengers (2012), Iron Man 3 (2013), Avengers:
                Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Avengers:
                Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019). The character also appeared in Spider-Man: Far From
                Home (2019).
                <br><br>
                Iron Man was ranked 12th on IGN's "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes" in 2011[2] and third in their list of "The
                Top 50 Avengers" in 2012.[3]

                    A billionaire industrialist and genius inventor, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), is conducting
                    weapons tests overseas, but terrorists kidnap him to force him to build a devastating weapon.
                    Instead, he builds an armored suit and upends his captors. Returning to America, Stark refines the
                    suit and uses it to combat crime and terrorism.
                    <br>
                    Tony Stark, who has inherited the defense contractor Stark Industries from his late father Howard
                    Stark, is in war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison, Lieutenant colonel James
                    Rhodes, to demonstrate the new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed
                    and Stark is critically wounded by a missile used by the attackers: one of his company's own. He is
                    captured and imprisoned in a cave by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings. Yinsen, a fellow
                    captive doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that
                    wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader Raza offers Stark freedom in
                    exchange for building a Jericho missile

                In the wake of a crushing defeat at Thanos' Infinity Stone-clad hands, the heroes of the Marvel
                Cinematic Universe will face their greatest challenge yet in Avengers: Endgame. But who is the greatest
                hero in the MCU? Over the next couple of weeks, SYFY WIRE will be debating who deserves the title of The
                Most Important Avenger. Our first contender is Iron Man, the hero who started it all.
                <br>
                Technically, Iron Man wasn't the first Avenger. That honor belongs to Captain America, as his first
                film's full title makes clear. Iron Man wasn't the second Avenger, either. Captain Marvel inspired Nick
                Fury — and even gave him the idea for the name "Avengers" — back in the '90s, well before Iron Man ever
                took flight. And yet, without Tony Stark, there would be no Avengers.
                <br>
                That's certainly true in the real world, as 2008's Iron Man is the film that started the entire MCU. If
                Iron Man had bombed, or if Robert Downey Jr. hadn't given such a charismatic performance as Tony Stark,
                we wouldn't be here today talking about the 22nd film in the series.
